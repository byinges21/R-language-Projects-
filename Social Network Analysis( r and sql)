Social Network Analysis
technology used: r and sql

Ever wondered how social connections differ across university campuses? 
This project dives deep into the hidden patterns of friendships at Berkeley, Duke, and Howard universities by analyzing their unique social network structures. 
Using data from the Facebook100 dataset, I uncover the dynamics that shape these academic communitiesâ€”who holds the most influence, 
how tightly knit the networks are, and where distinct social circles form. By comparing centrality measures, network density, and community structures,
this analysis offers fresh insights into the complex social fabric of student life across these three prestigious institutions.
